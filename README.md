On the site of Nasa (https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/LightCurveRepository/), we selected  a restricted area of the sky focused on a list of 1,186 transmitters, including 3 AGNs, by entering the following coordinates: RA (Right Ascension): 112, DEC (Declination): 3, and Radius: 60.
We conducted a comparative statistical study over time for each of these transmitters, covering a fixed period repeated three times over 10 years (2008, 2012, 2016). We chose an observation period and applied the same angular framing to all the studied objects.
Our study is divided into three parts:
-     Visualization of the transmitters and analysis of the observations
-     Statistical calculation and analysis of the transmitters
-     Statistical treatments of spatial autocorrelation
