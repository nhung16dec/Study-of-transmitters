On the site of Nasa (https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/LightCurveRepository/), we selected  a restricted area of the sky focused on a list of 1,186 transmitters, including 3 AGNs, by entering the following coordinates: RA (Right Ascension): 112, DEC (Declination): 3, and Radius: 60.
We conducted a comparative statistical study over time for each of these transmitters, covering a fixed period repeated three times over 10 years (2008, 2012, 2016). We chose an observation period and applied the same angular framing to all the studied objects.
Our study is divided into three parts:
-     Visualization of the transmitters and analysis of the observations
-     Statistical calculation and analysis of the transmitters
-     Statistical treatments of spatial autocorrelation
For the list of known transmitters, we selected from each of the following categories:
-  3	PSR	5 weeks per period
-  2 FSRQ, 2 BLZ, 2 BLL	10 weeks per period
-  3 BCU, 3 AGN, 3 UNK, 3 SNR 30 weeks per period

We downloaded FITS files at https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/lat/weekly/photon/ (Weeks 010 to 039, 210 to 239, 410 to 419, a total of 90 files) corresponding to the following:
- Period;	Week No.;	Start Date;	Start Time;	Week No.;	End Date
- 1;	010;	2008-08-07;		039;	2009-03-04
- 2;	210;	2012-06-07;		239;	2013-01-03
- 3;	410;	2016-04-07;		439;	2016-10-27
<p>This structured approach allowed us to conduct a comprehensive time-based comparison across different types of transmitters.</p>
